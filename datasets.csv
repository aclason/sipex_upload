1,Timber-focused Evaluation of Partial Cutting in BC Under the Forest and Range Evaluation Program,"In 2006, the ministry’s Forest and Range Evaluation Program
(FREP) initiated a project to develop methods to evaluate
in partial-cut areas the degree to which government’s
objectives for timber (as specified in the Forest and Range
Practices Act, FRPA) were being met. Methods for both
routine and intensive evaluation were developed and
then used in a trial evaluation. This report provides the
2006 draft version of the routine and intensive evaluation
procedures and presents the results of their application in
partial-cut stands in a management unit in south-eastern
BC.",BC Ministry of Forests,"

2,"Roberts Creek Study Forest: Harvesting, windthrow, and conifer regeneration within alternative silviculture systems","Throughout British Columbia (BC), social, legislative, and stewardship issues are driving forest managers to evaluate alternatives to clearcutting for harvesting and managing forests. The BC Ministry of Forests established the Roberts Creek Study Forest (RCSF) to demonstrate and evaluate different harvest treatments in mature, mixed-conifer forests along the lower slopes of the Sunshine Coast, just north of Vancouver, BC . Selected treatments were designed to meet a variety of biological, social, and economic objectives and had management objectives in common, including: regenerate with Douglas-fir (primary species) and western redcedar (secondary species) for sawlog production, and employ cable yarding systems to minimize soil disturbance",BC Ministry of Forests,"coastal forests, harvest, reforestation",Reforestation
3,Forest Carbon and Management Options in an Uncertain Climate,"One of the current climate change mitigation strategies is the management of forestedecosystems to ensure that they remain a sink for carbon now and into the future. WithBritish Columbia’s climate expected to continue to warm into the future, our forests willalso change in response. If a choice is made to manage for carbon as one of the manylandscape objectives, forest managers will need to know how best to do so given the likelychanges in natural disturbance regimes that may accompany the changing climate.",Forest Research Extension Partnership (FORREX),"harvest, reforestation, site preparation, intervention",Planting
